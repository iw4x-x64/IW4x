    // MinGW and MSVC differ in how they treat exports for DLLs.

    // MinGW (via GNU ld) allows producing a DLL with no explicitly exported
    // symbols. In that model, DllMain is treated as a special entry point
    // discovered by name and does not need to appear in the export table.
    //
    // MSVC's linker, on the other hand, requires at least one symbol to be
    // placed in the DLL export table. If no symbol is explicitly marked for
    // export (e.g. via __declspec(dllexport)), MSVC refuses to link the DLL
    // and reports that no exported symbols exist.
    //
    // For this reason, we explicitly export DllMain when building with MSVC,
    // even though this is unnecessary for MinGW and has no functional effect
    // at runtime.
